# Java-Developer-Training-Week-1-Assessment-Calculator-Project

As part of my ongoing Java Developer training program, I am given weekly assessments to apply what I’ve learned. This week’s task was to build a basic console-based Calculator using Java. The goal was to implement arithmetic operations using methods, switch statements, and user input with Scanner. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of control flow and modular programming in Java.
